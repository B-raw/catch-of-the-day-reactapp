# Catch of the Day
This is a fish-themed simple ecommerce store/menu where users can CRUD items, shop and sell items...

# Motivation
I did [Wes Bos' React for Beginners course](https://reactforbeginners.com/) to learn React. Prior to that I had been using a frontend framework called Blaze that shipped with Meteor.js - my fullstack framework of choice. 

I was interested to learn React because my brother had gotten really into it and raved about it - specifically the way it makes you think about web app development. So this was a really great opportunity to dip my toes into React.js.
